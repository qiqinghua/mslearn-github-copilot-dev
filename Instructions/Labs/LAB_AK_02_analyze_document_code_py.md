- Open a command terminal and then run the following commands:

    To ensure that Visual Studio Code is configured to use the correct version of Python, verify your Python installation is version 3.10 or later:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

    To ensure that Git is configured to use your name and email address, update the following commands with your information, and then run the commands:

    ```bash

    git config --global user.name "John Doe"

    ```

    ```bash

    git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

    ```

## Exercise scenario

You're a developer working in the IT department of your local community. The backend systems that support the public library were lost in a fire. Your team needs to develop a temporary project to help the library staff manage their operations until the system can be replaced. Your team chose GitHub Copilot to accelerate the development process.

Your colleague has developed an initial version of the library application, but due to time constraints, they haven't had a chance to document the code. You need to analyze the codebase and create documentation for the project.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

- Set up the library application in Visual Studio Code.
- Use GitHub Copilot to explain the library application codebase.
- Use GitHub Copilot to create a README.md file for the library application.

## Set up the library application in Visual Studio Code

Your colleague has developed an initial version of the library application and has made it available as a .zip file. You need to download the zip file, extract the code files, and then open the project in Visual Studio Code.

Use the following steps to set up the library application:

1. Open a browser window in your lab environment.

1. To download a zip file containing the library application, paste the following URL into your browser's address bar: [GitHub Copilot lab - Analyze and document code](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-github-copilot-dev/raw/refs/heads/main/DownloadableCodeProjects/Downloads/AZ2007LabAppM2Python.zip)

    The zip file named AZ2007LabAppM2Python.zip will be downloaded to your lab environment.

1. Extract the files from the **AZ2007LabAppM2Python.zip** file.

    For example:

    1. Navigate to the downloads folder in your lab environment.

    1. Right-click **AZ2007LabAppM2Python.zip**, and then select **Extract all**.

    1. Select **Show extracted files when complete**, and then select **Extract**.

1. Open the extracted files folder, then copy the **AccelerateDevGHCopilot** folder to a location that's easy to access, such as your Windows Desktop folder.

1. Open the **AccelerateDevGHCopilot** folder in Visual Studio Code.

    For example:

    1. Open Visual Studio Code in your lab environment.

    1. In Visual Studio Code, on the **File** menu, select **Open Folder**.

    1. Navigate to the Windows Desktop folder, select **AccelerateDevGHCopilot** and then select **Select Folder**.

1. In the Visual Studio Code EXPLORER view, verify the following project structure:

    - AccelerateDevGHCopilot/library
        ├── application_core
        ├── console
        ├── infrastructure
        └── tests

1. Ensure that the application runs successfully.

    For example, open a terminal in Visual Studio Code, navigate to the **AccelerateDevGHCopilot/library** directory, and run the following command:

    ```bash
    python -m unittest discover tests
    ```

    python：调用 Python 解释器。

-m unittest：以脚本方式运行 unittest 模块，使其作为主程序入口。

discover：是 unittest 的一个子命令，用于自动发现测试模块。它会递归搜索指定目录下所有符合命名模式（默认是 test*.py）的文件，并加载其中的测试用例。

tests：指定了要搜索的起始目录。这里即为当前目录下的 tests 文件夹。

执行该命令后，unittest 会在 tests 及其子目录中查找所有以 test 开头的 Python 文件，并运行其中定义的测试（继承自 unittest.TestCase 的类及其以 test 开头的方法）。这是一种常见的批量运行测试的方式，无需手动列出每个测试文件。
    unittest 并不是开发者自己编写的模块，而是 Python 标准库中的一个内置模块，专门用于编写和运行单元测试。它提供了测试用例组织、断言方法、测试运行器等基础设施，类似于 Java 中的 JUnit。

因为它是标准库的一部分，所以安装 Python 后就可以直接使用，无需通过 pip 额外安装。开发者只需 import unittest 即可在自己的测试代码中利用它。

如果你在命令行中执行 python -m unittest，Python 就会将 unittest 模块当作脚本来运行，从而启动测试发现或执行指定的测试。


    You'll see some Warnings, but there shouldn't be any Errors.

## Use GitHub Copilot to explain the library application codebase

GitHub Copilot can help you to understand an unfamiliar codebase by generating explanations at the project, file, and code line levels.

### Analyze code using prompts in the Chat view

GitHub Copilot's Chat view includes a chat-based interface that allows you to interact with GitHub Copilot using natural language prompts. When evaluating an existing codebase for the first time, you can create prompts that generate an explanation at the workspace or project level, or at the code block or code line level. To assist you in specifying the context of your prompt, GitHub Copilot provides chat participants, chat variables, and slash commands.

- Chat participants are used to scope your prompt to a specific domain.
- Chat variables are used to include specific context in your prompt.
- Slash commands are used to avoid writing complex prompts for common scenarios.

Use the following steps to complete this section of the exercise:

1. Ensure that the AccelerateDevGHCopilot/library project is open in Visual Studio Code.

1. Open GitHub Copilot's Chat view.

    To open the Chat view, select the **Toggle Chat** button at the top of the Visual Studio Code window.

    ![Screenshot showing the GitHub Copilot status menu.](./Media/m02-github-copilot-toggle-chat.png)

    You can also open the Chat view using the **Ctrl+Alt+I** keyboard shortcut.

1. In the Chat view, enter a prompt that uses GitHub Copilot's **@workspace** Chat participant to generate a description of the project.

    For example, enter the following prompt in the Chat view:

    ```plaintext
    @workspace describe this project
    ```

    Use Chat participants, such as the **@workspace**, to improve the responses generated by GitHub Copilot. Chat participants work like domain experts who can help you in their specialized areas. Use **@workspace** when you want GitHub Copilot to consider the structure of your project, how different parts of your code interact, or design patterns in your project.

    To see a list of all available chat participants, type **@** in the chat prompt box.

1. Take a minute to compare GitHub Copilot's response with the actual project files.

    You should see a response that describes each of the projects in the project:

    - **application_core**
    - **infrastructure**
    - **console**
    - **tests**

1. Use the EXPLORER view to expand the project folders.

1. Locate and then open the **console_app.py** file.

    The **console_app.py** file is located in the **application _core\console** folder.

1. Take a moment to review the code file.

1. Enter a prompt in the Chat view that generates a description of the **console_app.py** class.

    For example, enter the following prompt in the Chat view:

    ```plaintext
    @workspace #usages How is the ConsoleApp class used?
    ```

    Use chat variables, such as **#usages**, to include specific context in your prompt. To see a list of the chat variables, type **#** in the chat prompt box.

    > **NOTE**: GitHub Copilot considers your chat history and the code files you have open in Visual Studio Code when constructing a context for your prompt and generating a response.

1. Take a minute to verify the accuracy of GitHub Copilot's response.

    You should see a response that the describes where the **ConsoleApp** class is defined and how it's used in the codebase. The **console_app.py** and **main.py** files are referenced in the response, along with line numbers

1. Open the **main.py** file from the root of the **application _core\console** folder and examine the code.

1. Enter a prompt in the Chat view that generates an explanation of the **main.py** file.

    For example, enter the following prompt in the Chat view:

    ```plaintext
    @workspace /explain Explain the main.py file
    ```

    Use Slash commands, such as **/explain**, to avoid writing complex prompts for common scenarios. To see a list of all available slash commands, type **/** in the chat prompt box. Available slash commands may vary, depending on your environment and the context of your chat.

1. Take a minute to review the detailed response generated by GitHub Copilot.

    You should see a response that includes an overview and a breakdown that explains how the file is used within the application.

1. Close the **main.py** file.

### Improve chat responses by adding context

GitHub Copilot uses context to generate more relevant responses.

Opening files in the code editor is one way to establish context, but you can also add files to the Chat context using drag-and-drop operations or by using the **Attach Context** button in the Chat view.

Use the following steps to complete this section of the exercise:

1. Expand the **Infrastructure** folder.

1. Use a drag-and-drop operation to add the following files from the EXPLORER view to the Chat context: **json_data.py**, **json_loan_repository.py**, and **json_patron_repository.py**.

    GitHub Copilot uses the Chat Context to understand the code files that are relevant to your prompt. You can add files to the Chat context using drag-and-drop operations, or you can use the **Attach Context** button in the Chat view.

    Instead of adding individual files manually, you can let Copilot find the right files from your codebase automatically. This can be useful when you don't know which files are relevant to your question.

    To let Copilot find the right files automatically, add #codebase in your prompt or select Codebase from the list of context types.

1. Enter a prompt in the Chat view that generates an explanation of the data access classes.

    For example, enter the following prompt in the Chat view:

    ```plaintext
    @workspace /explain Explain how the data access classes work
    ```

1. Take a couple minutes to read through the response.

    You should see a response that describes each of the data access classes (**json_data.py**, **json_loan_repository.py**, and **json_patron_repository.py**) and how they work together to manage data access in the application. Key methods, such as **load_data**, **save_loans**, and **save_patrons**, should be mentioned in the response.

1. Take a minute to examine the JSON data files that are used to simulate library records.

    The JSON data files are located in the **infrastructure/json** folder.

    The data files use ID properties to link entities. For example, a **loan** object has a **patron_id** property that links to a **patron** object with the same ID. The JSON files contain data for authors, books, book items, patrons, and loans.

    > **NOTE**: Notice that Author names, book titles, and patron names have been anonymized for the purposes of this training.

### Build and run the application

Running the application helps you understand the user interface, key features of the application, and how app components interact.

Use the following steps to complete this section of the exercise:

1. Ensure that you have the **Explorer** view open.

1. To run the application in Visual Studio Code using Python, open **console/main.py** in the editor, press **CTRL+Shift+D** to open the Run and Debug panel, choose **Python: Current File** or another debug configuration, and then **F5** to start debugging.

    The following steps guide you through a simple use case.

1. When prompted for a patron name, type **One** and then press Enter.

    You should see a list of patrons that match the search query.

    > **NOTE**: The application uses a case-sensitive search process.

1. At the "Input Options" prompt, type **2** and then press Enter.

    Entering **2** selects the second patron in the list.

    You should see the patron's name and membership status followed by book loan details.

1. At the "Input Options" prompt, type **1** and then press Enter.

    Entering **1** selects the first book in the list.

    You should see book details listed, including the due date and return status.

1. At the "Input Options" prompt, type **r** and then press Enter.

    Entering **r** returns the book.

1. Verify that the message "Book was successfully returned." is displayed.

    The message "Book was successfully returned." should be followed by the book details. Returned books are marked with **Returned: True**.

1. To begin a new search, type **s** and then press Enter.

1. When prompted for a patron name, type **One** and then press Enter.

1. At the "Input Options" prompt, type **2** and then press Enter.

1. Verify that first book loan is marked **Returned: True**.

1. At the "Input Options" prompt, type **q** and then press Enter.

1. Stop the debug session.

## Create the project documentation for the README file

Readme files provide project contributors and stakeholders with essential information about a code repository. They help users understand the purpose of the project, how to use it, and how to contribute. A well-structured README file can significantly improve the usability and maintainability of a project.

You need a README file that includes the following sections:

- **Project Title**: A brief, clear title for the project.
- **Description**: A detailed explanation of what the project is and what it does.
- **Project Structure**: A breakdown of the project structure, including key folders and files.
- **Key Classes and Interfaces**: A list of key classes and interfaces in the project.
- **Usage**: Instructions on how to use the project, often including code examples.
- **License**: The license that the project is under.

In this section of the exercise, you'll use GitHub Copilot to create project documentation and add it to a **README.md** file.

Use the following steps to complete this section of the exercise:

1. Add a new file named **README.md** to the root folder of the **AccelerateDevGHCopilot** project.

1. Open the Chat view.

1. To generate project documentation for your README file, enter the following prompt:

    ```plaintext
    @workspace Generate the contents of a README.md file for a code repository. 
    Use "Library App" as the project title. The README file should include the 
    following sections: Description, Project Structure, Key Classes and Interfaces, 
    Usage, License. Format all sections as raw markdown. Use a bullet list with 
    indents to represent the project structure. Do not include ".gitignore", ".
    pyc", or the ".github", "__pycache__" folders.
    ```

    > **NOTE**: Using multiple prompts, one for each section of the README file would produce more detailed results. A single prompt is used in this exercise to simplify the process.

1. Review the response to ensure each section is formatted as markdown.

    You can update sections individually to provide more detailed information or if they aren't formatted correctly. You can also copy GitHub Copilot's response to the README file and then make corrections directly in the markdown file.

1. Copy the suggested documentation, and then paste it into the README.md file.

    To copy the entire response, scroll to the bottom of the response, right-click in the empty space to the right of the "thumbs-up" icon, and then select **Copy**

1. Format the README.md file as needed.

    You can update the settings for GitHub Copilot to enable markdown formatting, then use GitHub Copilot to help you update sections of the README.md file.

    When you're finished, you should have a README.md file that includes each of the specified sections, with an appropriate level of detail.

## Summary

In this exercise, you learned how to use GitHub Copilot to analyze and document a codebase. You used GitHub Copilot to generate explanations for the project structure, key classes, and data access classes. You also used GitHub Copilot to create a README.md file for the project.

## Clean up

Now that you've finished the exercise, take a minute to ensure that you haven't made changes to your GitHub account or GitHub Copilot subscription that you don't want to keep. If you made any changes, revert them now.
